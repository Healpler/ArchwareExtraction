# ArchwareExtraction
As a cybersecurity thesis assistant in the French laboratory IRISA, I searched how to extract the vulnerability assets from CAPEC. I used R language to do XML extraction and processes of VA extraction. A BASH application has been written and allows to use this tool thanks a command prompt (Linux Distributions only at the moment).
